Question:
If the table size is more than 20,000 and the words to insert are 8000, is the above hashing algorithm adequate ? why ?


Answer:
The hashing algorithm uses quadratic probing to avoid collision and I have maintained the load factor as 0.5.

Load factor = No.of elements occupied in hash table / Hash Table size

When inserting new element, I check the load factor. If the load factor comes above 0.5, I increase the table size to the next closest
double prime and then rehash all the items in the table.

So, when the table size is more than 20000 and words to insert are 8000, the hashing algorithm is adequate and we will still have empty 
spaces to insert these words as load factor is below 0.5 (close to 0.4) when inserting 8000th word.

Load factor when inserting 8000th word will be, 
Load factor = 8000/20000 = 0.4
